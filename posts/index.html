By the end, you will have a better understanding of how Semgrep can improve your code review process and make your code more secure, reliable and maintainable.&LT/p>\n&LTh2 id=\"introduction-to-semgrep-and-why-it-is-useful-for-code-review\">Introduction to Semgrep and why it is useful for code review&LT/h2>\n&LTp>Code review is an essential part of the SDLC(software development live cycle). It helps ensure that the code is correct, maintainable, secure, and follows the agreed-upon standards and conventions. However, manual code review can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially for large codebases with many contributors or long time history.&LT/p>\n&LTspan id=\"continue-reading\">&LT/span>\n&LTp>&LTimg src=\"https://img.eindex.me/img/e23bd0bbaf9d2513d3d26042b1aa702b.png\" alt=\"Semgrep compare with AST and regex\" />&LT/p>\n&LTp>Enter Semgrep, a tool for statically analyzing code and detecting common issues. Semgrep runs mostly language-agnostic analysis on analysis-friendly IR(intermediate language) which translate by AST(abstract syntax tree) tree. This process will not generate AST tree via your entile project with dependencies like CodeQL. So semgrep can run it quick and easy to create rules to find and fix common problems in your code, such as security vulnerabilities, logical errors, and style violations.&LT/p>\n&LTh2 id=\"setting-up-semgrep-for-your-project\">Setting up Semgrep for your project&LT/h2>\n&LTp>To use Semgrep, you need to install the semgrep command-line tool on your system. The installation process varies depending on your operating system and package manager, but in general, you can use the following command:&LT/p>\n&LTpre data-lang=\"bash\" style=\"background-color:#272822;color:#f8f8f2;\" class=\"language-bash \">&LTcode class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">&LTspan>pip install semgrep\n&LT/span>&LT/code>&LT/pre>\n&LTp>Once you have installed Semgrep, you can use it to scan your codebase for specific patterns. For example, the following command will search for instances of the strcpy function, which is considered insecure and should not be used:&LT/p>\n&LTpre data-lang=\"bash\" style=\"background-color:#272822;color:#f8f8f2;\" class=\"language-bash \">&LTcode class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">&LTspan>semgrep&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"font-style:italic;color:#fd971f;\"> --config&LT/span>&LTspan> p/python&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"font-style:italic;color:#fd971f;\"> --pattern &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">&amp#39;strcpy(x, y)&amp#39;&LT/span>&LTspan> path/to/code\n&LT/span>&LT/code>&LT/pre>\n&LTp>The &LTcode>--config&LT/code> option specifies the configuration to use for the scan, and the &LTcode>--pattern&LT/code> option specifies the rule to match. In this case, I are using the &LTcode>p/python&LT/code> configuration, which includes rules for detecting common issues in Python code, and I are looking for occurrences of the strcpy function.&LT/p>\n&LTp>You can also finding more rules on the semgrep registry on your project, there are a lot of open source rules provide from semgrep community, &LTa rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://semgrep.dev/explore\">link to registry&LT/a>. &LT/p>\n&LTp>Once you have set up Semgrep and run a scan, you can use the results to identify and fix potential problems in your code. This can save time and effort during code review, as it allows you to automatically detect and address common issues before they are reviewed by your team.&LT/p>\n&LTh2 id=\"examples-of-common-code-issues-that-semgrep-can-detect\">Examples of common code issues that Semgrep can detect&LT/h2>\n&LTp>Semgrep can detect a wide range of code issues, depending on the configuration and rules that you use. Here are some examples of common code issues that Semgrep can help you find and fix:&LT/p>\n&LTul>\n&LTli>Security vulnerabilities, such as &LTa rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://semgrep.dev/p/sql-injection\">SQL injection&LT/a> and &LTa rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://semgrep.dev/p/xss\">Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)&LT/a> vulnerabilities, or you can use &LTa rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://semgrep.dev/p/owasp-top-ten\">OWASP Top 10&LT/a> ruleset for common web security vulnerabilities.&LT/li>\n&LTli>Deprecated or unsafe API usage, such as the use of strcpy in C or eval in JavaScript&LT/li>\n&LTli>Misconfgration, such as &LTa rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://semgrep.dev/p/dockerfile\">dockerfile&LT/a>, &LTa rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://semgrep.dev/p/docker-compose\">docker-compose&LT/a> settings.&LT/li>\n&LTli>Hard-coded secret, such as the &LTa rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://semgrep.dev/p/secrets\">secret&LT/a> ruleset.&LT/li>\n&LTli>Style violations, such as inconsistent indentation, unused variables, catch default issues and overly complex expressions&LT/li>\n&LTli>Permission issue, such as forgot add permission check. Need to write custom rules.&LT/li>\n&LT/ul>\n&LTp>By using Semgrep to detect these issues, you can prevent bugs and security risks in your code and improve its overall quality. This can save time and effort during code review, as it allows you to focus on higher-level design and architecture issues instead of catching low-level mistakes.&LT/p>\n&LTp>In the next section, I will share some best practices when I using Semgrep in code review.&LT/p>\n&LTp>or create your own configuration and rules to customize Semgrep for your project.

I found the concept very interesting and decided to join the webmentions community for my blog.&LT/p>\n&LTspan id=\"continue-reading\">&LT/span>&LTh2 id=\"what-are-webmentions\">What are webmentions&LT/h2>\n&LTp>Webmentions are a way for websites to communicate with each other and notify each other when they link to each other's content. This allows for a more interactive and connected online community, where websites can engage with each other and their users in real-time.&LT/p>\n&LTh2 id=\"how-do-i-join-the-webmentions-community\">How do I join the webmentions community?&LT/h2>\n&LTp>To join the webmentions community and start receiving notifications when other websites link to your content, you need to take the following steps:&LT/p>\n&LTol>\n&LTli>\n&LTp>Register your website with a webmention service, such as webmention.io. This will allow your website to receive webmentions from other sites and also enable you to send webmentions to other sites when you link to them. To do this, you can add the following HTML code to your website:&LT/p>\n&LTpre data-lang=\"HTML\" style=\"background-color:#272822;color:#f8f8f2;\" class=\"language-HTML \">&LTcode class=\"language-HTML\" data-lang=\"HTML\">&LTspan>&amplt;&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">link &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">rel&LT/span>&LTspan>=&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">&ampquot;webmention&ampquot; &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">href&LT/span>&LTspan>=&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">&ampquot;https://webmention.io/eindex.me/webmention&ampquot; &LT/span>&LTspan>/&ampgt;\n&LT/span>&LTspan>&amplt;&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">link &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">rel&LT/span>&LTspan>=&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">&ampquot;pingback&ampquot; &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">href&LT/span>&LTspan>=&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">&ampquot;https://webmention.io/eindex.me/xmlrpc&ampquot; &LT/span>&LTspan>/&ampgt;\n&LT/span>&LT/code>&LT/pre>\n&LT/li>\n&LTli>\n&LTp>Make sure your website follows the &LTa rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://microformats.org/\">microformats2&LT/a> standard. This may require some effort, but it is important for ensuring that your website can properly send and receive webmentions. You can use a tool like &LTa rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://indiewebify.me/\">IndieWebify.Me&LT/a> to check if your website is using microformats2 correctly. You may also want to use a tool like &LTcode>ngrok&LT/code> or &LTcode>cloudflare tunnel&LT/code> to debug your website locally, which can save you time.&LT/p>\n&LT/li>\n&LTli>\n&LTp>Start sending and receiving webmentions on your website. Once your website is registered with a webmention service and you have tested your implementation, you can start using webmentions on your site. Whenever you link to another website, you can send a webmention to notify them of your link. And whenever someone else links to your website, you can receive a webmention notification and display that link on your site.&LT/p>\n&LT/li>\n&LTli>\n&LTp>Consider using tools like Github actions and JavaScript scripts to automate the process of sending and receiving webmentions. This is particularly useful for static websites. For example, you can store your webmentions in a &LTcode>webmentions&LT/code> branch on Github, and use a workflow file like this to fetch webmentions and send your webmentions, you also can check my &LTa rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/EINDEX/blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/fetch-webmentions.yaml\">implement&LT/a> for this blog:&LT/p>\n&LTpre data-lang=\"yaml\" style=\"background-color:#272822;color:#f8f8f2;\" class=\"language-yaml \">&LTcode class=\"language-yaml\" data-lang=\"yaml\">&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">name&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">Fetch Webmentions\n&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#ae81ff;\">on&LT/span>&LTspan>:\n&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">schedule&LT/span>&LTspan>:\n&LT/span>&LTspan> - &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">cron&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">&ampquot;0 0 * * *&ampquot;\n&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">jobs&LT/span>&LTspan>:\n&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">fetch_webmentions&LT/span>&LTspan>:\n&LT/span>&LTspan> &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">runs-on&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">ubuntu-latest\n&LT/span>&LTspan> &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">steps&LT/span>&LTspan>:\n&LT/span>&LTspan> - &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">uses&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">actions/checkout@v2\n&LT/span>&LTspan> &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">with&LT/span>&LTspan>:\n&LT/span>&LTspan> &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">ref&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">webmentions\n&LT/span>&LTspan> - &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">name&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">Fetch Webmentions\n&LT/span>&LTspan> &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">run&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">node pipeline/webmentions.js\n&LT/span>&LTspan> - &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">name&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">Send Webmetnions \n&LT/span>&LTspan> &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">run&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">node pipeline/send-webmentions.js\n&LT/span>&LT/code>&LT/pre>\n&LT/li>\n&LT/ol>\n&LTp>By following these steps, you can join the webmentions community and start enjoying the benefits of more interactive and engaging communication with other websites and their users.&LT/p>\n&LTh2 id=\"why-join-the-webmentions-community\">Why join the webmentions community?&LT/h2>\n&LTp>There are many potential benefits to joining the webmentions community and implementing webmentions on your website. Some of the potential benefits include:&LT/p>\n&LTul>\n&LTli>\n&LTp>Increased engagement and connectivity with other websites and theirusers. By receiving notifications when other websites link to your content and being able to notify other websites when you link to them, you can foster a more interactive and connected online community. This can lead to increased traffic and potentially even more opportunities for collaboration and engagement.&LT/p>\n&LT/li>\n&LTli>\n&LTp>Improved communication and collaboration with other websites.

This allows for a more interactive and connected online community, where websites can engage with each other and their users in real-time.&LT/p>\n&LTh2 id=\"how-do-i-join-the-webmentions-community\">How do I join the webmentions community?&LT/h2>\n&LTp>To join the webmentions community and start receiving notifications when other websites link to your content, you need to take the following steps:&LT/p>\n&LTol>\n&LTli>\n&LTp>Register your website with a webmention service, such as webmention.io. This will allow your website to receive webmentions from other sites and also enable you to send webmentions to other sites when you link to them. To do this, you can add the following HTML code to your website:&LT/p>\n&LTpre data-lang=\"HTML\" style=\"background-color:#272822;color:#f8f8f2;\" class=\"language-HTML \">&LTcode class=\"language-HTML\" data-lang=\"HTML\">&LTspan>&amplt;&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">link &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">rel&LT/span>&LTspan>=&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">&ampquot;webmention&ampquot; &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">href&LT/span>&LTspan>=&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">&ampquot;https://webmention.io/eindex.me/webmention&ampquot; &LT/span>&LTspan>/&ampgt;\n&LT/span>&LTspan>&amplt;&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">link &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">rel&LT/span>&LTspan>=&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">&ampquot;pingback&ampquot; &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">href&LT/span>&LTspan>=&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">&ampquot;https://webmention.io/eindex.me/xmlrpc&ampquot; &LT/span>&LTspan>/&ampgt;\n&LT/span>&LT/code>&LT/pre>\n&LT/li>\n&LTli>\n&LTp>Make sure your website follows the &LTa rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://microformats.org/\">microformats2&LT/a> standard. This may require some effort, but it is important for ensuring that your website can properly send and receive webmentions. You can use a tool like &LTa rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://indiewebify.me/\">IndieWebify.Me&LT/a> to check if your website is using microformats2 correctly. You may also want to use a tool like &LTcode>ngrok&LT/code> or &LTcode>cloudflare tunnel&LT/code> to debug your website locally, which can save you time.&LT/p>\n&LT/li>\n&LTli>\n&LTp>Start sending and receiving webmentions on your website. Once your website is registered with a webmention service and you have tested your implementation, you can start using webmentions on your site. Whenever you link to another website, you can send a webmention to notify them of your link. And whenever someone else links to your website, you can receive a webmention notification and display that link on your site.&LT/p>\n&LT/li>\n&LTli>\n&LTp>Consider using tools like Github actions and JavaScript scripts to automate the process of sending and receiving webmentions. This is particularly useful for static websites. For example, you can store your webmentions in a &LTcode>webmentions&LT/code> branch on Github, and use a workflow file like this to fetch webmentions and send your webmentions, you also can check my &LTa rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/EINDEX/blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/fetch-webmentions.yaml\">implement&LT/a> for this blog:&LT/p>\n&LTpre data-lang=\"yaml\" style=\"background-color:#272822;color:#f8f8f2;\" class=\"language-yaml \">&LTcode class=\"language-yaml\" data-lang=\"yaml\">&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">name&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">Fetch Webmentions\n&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#ae81ff;\">on&LT/span>&LTspan>:\n&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">schedule&LT/span>&LTspan>:\n&LT/span>&LTspan> - &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">cron&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">&ampquot;0 0 * * *&ampquot;\n&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">jobs&LT/span>&LTspan>:\n&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">fetch_webmentions&LT/span>&LTspan>:\n&LT/span>&LTspan> &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">runs-on&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">ubuntu-latest\n&LT/span>&LTspan> &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">steps&LT/span>&LTspan>:\n&LT/span>&LTspan> - &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">uses&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">actions/checkout@v2\n&LT/span>&LTspan> &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">with&LT/span>&LTspan>:\n&LT/span>&LTspan> &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">ref&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">webmentions\n&LT/span>&LTspan> - &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">name&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">Fetch Webmentions\n&LT/span>&LTspan> &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">run&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">node pipeline/webmentions.js\n&LT/span>&LTspan> - &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">name&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">Send Webmetnions \n&LT/span>&LTspan> &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#f92672;\">run&LT/span>&LTspan>: &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">node pipeline/send-webmentions.js\n&LT/span>&LT/code>&LT/pre>\n&LT/li>\n&LT/ol>\n&LTp>By following these steps, you can join the webmentions community and start enjoying the benefits of more interactive and engaging communication with other websites and their users.&LT/p>\n&LTh2 id=\"why-join-the-webmentions-community\">Why join the webmentions community?&LT/h2>\n&LTp>There are many potential benefits to joining the webmentions community and implementing webmentions on your website.

It helps ensure that the code is correct, maintainable, secure, and follows the agreed-upon standards and conventions. However, manual code review can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially for large codebases with many contributors or long time history.&LT/p>\n&LTspan id=\"continue-reading\">&LT/span>\n&LTp>&LTimg src=\"https://img.eindex.me/img/e23bd0bbaf9d2513d3d26042b1aa702b.png\" alt=\"Semgrep compare with AST and regex\" />&LT/p>\n&LTp>Enter Semgrep, a tool for statically analyzing code and detecting common issues. Semgrep runs mostly language-agnostic analysis on analysis-friendly IR(intermediate language) which translate by AST(abstract syntax tree) tree. This process will not generate AST tree via your entile project with dependencies like CodeQL. So semgrep can run it quick and easy to create rules to find and fix common problems in your code, such as security vulnerabilities, logical errors, and style violations.&LT/p>\n&LTh2 id=\"setting-up-semgrep-for-your-project\">Setting up Semgrep for your project&LT/h2>\n&LTp>To use Semgrep, you need to install the semgrep command-line tool on your system. The installation process varies depending on your operating system and package manager, but in general, you can use the following command:&LT/p>\n&LTpre data-lang=\"bash\" style=\"background-color:#272822;color:#f8f8f2;\" class=\"language-bash \">&LTcode class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">&LTspan>pip install semgrep\n&LT/span>&LT/code>&LT/pre>\n&LTp>Once you have installed Semgrep, you can use it to scan your codebase for specific patterns. For example, the following command will search for instances of the strcpy function, which is considered insecure and should not be used:&LT/p>\n&LTpre data-lang=\"bash\" style=\"background-color:#272822;color:#f8f8f2;\" class=\"language-bash \">&LTcode class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">&LTspan>semgrep&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"font-style:italic;color:#fd971f;\"> --config&LT/span>&LTspan> p/python&LT/span>&LTspan style=\"font-style:italic;color:#fd971f;\"> --pattern &LT/span>&LTspan style=\"color:#e6db74;\">&amp#39;strcpy(x, y)&amp#39;&LT/span>&LTspan> path/to/code\n&LT/span>&LT/code>&LT/pre>\n&LTp>The &LTcode>--config&LT/code> option specifies the configuration to use for the scan, and the &LTcode>--pattern&LT/code> option specifies the rule to match. In this case, I are using the &LTcode>p/python&LT/code> configuration, which includes rules for detecting common issues in Python code, and I are looking for occurrences of the strcpy function.&LT/p>\n&LTp>You can also finding more rules on the semgrep registry on your project, there are a lot of open source rules provide from semgrep community, &LTa rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://semgrep.dev/explore\">link to registry&LT/a>. &LT/p>\n&LTp>Once you have set up Semgrep and run a scan, you can use the results to identify and fix potential problems in your code. This can save time and effort during code review, as it allows you to automatically detect and address common issues before they are reviewed by your team.&LT/p>\n&LTh2 id=\"examples-of-common-code-issues-that-semgrep-can-detect\">Examples of common code issues that Semgrep can detect&LT/h2>\n&LTp>Semgrep can detect a wide range of code issues, depending on the configuration and rules that you use.
