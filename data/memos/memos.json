    "content": "[Advices from a Software Engineer with 8 Years of Experience - DEV Community](https://dev.to/ruizb/advices-from-a-software-engineer-with-8-years-of-experience-2n0l)\n\nThis is very useful. I totally agree with what you said. I have seven years of working experience. In the beginning of my career, I worked for a small startup company for almost two years. During that time, I spent most of my time on hard skills, such as high IO tech and search optimization.\n\nAfter joining another company, I discovered that they don’t rely solely on hard technology skills. They have many conversion and discussion meetings that allow everyone to share context and avoid relying on a single person. This experience helped me develop my soft skills.\n\nI also love adventure, and my company provides a lot of opportunities to switch roles and get in touch with new domains and infrastructure. I have worked in many roles, such as Salesforce developer, back-end developer, data engineer, front-end developer, application security specialist, DevOps, and security code reviewer. Every time I switched to a new domain was a huge challenge, but it also made me stronger and gave me a lot of skills. I learned a lot from working with different people.\n\nOne thing that I learned from this article is the importance of a work log. I haven’t been keeping one for a long time, and that has resulted in me losing memory of some amazing output from a long time ago. Any scale cloud can help a person keep a work log. Additionally, I really hate performance reviews, but they are necessary to get a promotion or show output. Otherwise, your teammates may trust you, but any other person or leader in another team is unlikely to know what you are doing. As coincidence would have it, I decided to build a weekly newsletter to share what I see and what I am doing in public.\n\nThank you for sharing your insights."
