Today was adding security.txt to my blog system.
Security.txt belongs to [RFC 9116: A File Format to Aid in Security Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116.html#name-introduction)
Which is welcome write hacker to connect when security vulnerability happens. 

The simple commit, [here](https://github.com/EINDEX/Blog/commit/5a328136a00322aeeebcc3021b8ce4d6fb247919). generate by [Security.txt](https://securitytxt.org/), I'm not sign the it yet, cause I plan to renew my gpg key to domain email.
