[(reply)In Praise of Top Down Programming](https://www.i-programmer.info/professional-programmer/i-programmer/3864-in-praise-of-top-down-.html)
I like top down too, always using this method to problem solving and programming, that can easy start from 0 to 1, but it may leading to problem which not have any solution yet, but already put effort on above level, that will making a issue.

So my suctions are flow the top down design, found the MVP scope, spike all leafs, start with most hard to archive one. 
That way can making me avoid wast time.
